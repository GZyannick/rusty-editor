Error:
[ ] a, i does not work as intended both are the same
	 (need to find how to make it bug to repair it)
[ ] line 0 still not properly draw each loop
[ ] line 0 when doing search is not clear properly and think is not search the cause

TODO LIST
[x] transform help keybinds to  map {} , normal, explorer, ....

[x] get a modifiable bool in viewport

[ x] Separate keybind in show_keybinds with name of each and remove duplicate keybinds instead show the keybind with the associated mode

[ ] Make a check up on the app, document it
[ ] Start writing test 

[ ] make a fn where i check if i can insert with + 1 if line is not empty 
[ ] make that tmp buffer doesn't need to check if viewport is saved before
[ ] handle multiple viewport
or see if i can somehow transform a part of viewport draw to clojure like that the user can do whatever he want with
or like give him stdout


[ ] make the possibility to change keybind in a config file by the user that i loaded before running KeyManager 
[ ] Later: draw keybind like whichkey or lazyvim
[] :remap to be able to remap a keybind directly
